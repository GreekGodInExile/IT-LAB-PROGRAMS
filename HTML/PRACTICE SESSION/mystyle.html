<p id="para1">Eragon—a fifteen-year-old farmboy—is shocked when a polished blue
stone appears before him in the range of mountains known as the Spine.
Eragon takes the stone to the farm where he lives with his uncle, Gar-
row, and his cousin, Roran. Garrow and his late wife, Marian, have raised
Eragon. Nothing is known of his father; his mother, Selena, was Garrow’s
sister and has not been seen since Eragon’s birth.</p>

<p class=colortext>Later, the stone cracks open and a baby dragon emerges. When Eragon touches her, a silvery mark appears on his palm, and an irrevocable bond is forged between their minds, making Eragon one of the legendary Dragon Riders.</p>

Why do we use it?</p>

<p class=dotted>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
